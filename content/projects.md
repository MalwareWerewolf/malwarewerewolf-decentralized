I made many projects before and during my career path and I wanted to list on my website the most important ones. Some of these projects have been published on other platforms and shared on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChBOmFUlCVeQa0P7mq5eDDQ), others have been published on [Github](https://github.com/MalwareWerewolf) and others have just a simple presentation. Each project has a short description about what was needed to be done and the tools used.

## WerewolfSuperUtils.js

Some utilities that I made with **vanilla Javascript** to improve the content of my website. These scripts are compatible with Markdown code generated by [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo). The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/MalwareWerewolf/WerewolfSuperUtils.js).

I couldn't resist to put on this page my website, I first started with [Jekyll](https://github.com/MalwareWerewolf/Personal-Website-in-Jekyll) to build my blog and **Firebase**, then I dediced to switch to **Hugo** and **Netflify**. I did many changes to the [Hugo Coder theme](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder), I often add new sections and I update some features on this website. Each time a new **commit** is made on the **master branch**, the build of the website with **Hugo** is automatically managed by **Netlify** through a **CI/CD** process. The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/MalwareWerewolf/Davide-Dolce-Hugo-website).

At the moment, I'm hosting a [decentralized version](https://github.com/MalwareWerewolf/malwarewerewolf-decentralized) of my website using [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) as hosting service and [fleek.co](https://fleek.co/) to deploy the code. I also developed and published a custom [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/drakobombo/hugo-extended-fleek) to deploy correctly my website which is using the extended version of Hugo.

**W3SuperAdmin** is a Desktop application for **Windows 10**, you can manage different settings for **Warcraft III** without launching the game. I built this application with **Windows Forms** using **Visual Studio 2019** and **.NET Framework 4.7.2**. All these settings are easily changeable using the **Registry Editor** of Windows, the tool just make all the process very easy without messing with the keys. It supports the most recent versions **Warcraft III** but not the **Reforged** release. You can view the project on [Github](https://github.com/MalwareWerewolf/W3SuperAdmin).
