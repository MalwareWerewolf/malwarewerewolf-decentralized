Playing Windows games on macOS can be tricky, especially if the game requires more than a few tweaks to make it work. I was checking the [Apple Gaming Wiki](https://www.applegamingwiki.com/wiki/Home) but some information is missing or incorrect to get a game running. Use the wiki as a reference but do your own research to find out how to run a specific game.

It is possible to play God of War on macOS but only if you reverse the exe file and you patch a few assembly instructions. This method has been shared by the developer [Nas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHIc_bFypnCNEHi_1Czjy9w) and [Andrew Tsai](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ-hl32h5CokBhlGu95C1Xg) made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD3v9NYllHo) about God of War.

Regarding the tools, you need [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover) to run the game and the free version of [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/) to patch the file.

## Remove checks for Windows 10

Launching the game through Steam will result in an error: 

!["You need Windows 10 error"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/youNeedWindows10Error.png)

Even creating a Windows 10 bottle does not solve this issue so the only way to get the game working is to patch the exe. Navigate to your God of War directory, drag and drop **GoW.exe** in IDA Pro after clicking on **Go Work on your own**, you can easily access the **directory** by right clicking on the **Steam bottle** or another bottle that you are currently using in CrossOver, to open the **C: Drive** in **Finder**.

After the file has been loaded in IDA Pro, open the **Strings subview** in the **App Menu**:

!["Open Strings SubView"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/openStringsSubView.png)

Right click in the view to select **Quick Filter**, a text box will appear at the bottom, type the error "_You need at least Windows 10_" to filter the results:

!["Open Strings SubView"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/subviewResultsWindows10.png)

Double click on the only displaying result, you should be in the text view with an instruction being highlighted:

!["Text View Windows 10 Error"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/textViewWindows10Error.png)

Right click on it to select "_List cross references to..._" and pick the first option:

!["Cross references Windows 10 error"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/crossReferencesWindows10Error.png)

Now you should be in the **Graph View**, double click on the arrow right on top the following **Group Nodes** to go the ```jnz``` instruction that we need to change:

!["Block Arrow Windows 10 Error"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/blockArrowWindows10Error.png)

To patch the ```jnz``` instruction, simply click on it, after that in the App Menu click on ```Edit -> Patch program -> Assemble...```:

!["Patch JNZ Windows Error "](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/PatchJNZWindows10Error.png)

Replace ```jnz``` with ```jmp``` to skip the check for Windows 10:

!["Apply patch windows 10 error"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/applyPatchJNZWindows10.png)

After clicking **OK**, a few popups will come up asking you to patch other instructions, since we only needed to change the ```jnz``` instruction you can ignore them. 

We still need to patch one more ```jnz``` regarding the Windows 10 error, go back to **Strings subview** and search again for the error, right click on the line and select "_List cross references to..._"  this time we are interested in the second instruction of the two. Trace back to ```jnz``` and patch it with another ```jmp``` as you did before. If you did everything correctly, you should see in the subview ```Patched bytes``` two addresses being changed:

!["Patch bytes first part"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/patchedByesFirstPart.png)

## Remove checks for Direct3D

If you patch and launch the exe you will get another error:

!["Direct 3D Error"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/Direct3DError.png)

So the first two checks for Windows 10 are patched, but we still need to remove two more checks regarding **Direct3D** to run the game. Open again the **Strings subview** and filter the message showed in the above screenshot, double click on the only line being displayed, right click to list all the references and pick the only option available. You should be in the following Group Nodes:

!["D3D Group Nodes Version Not Supported"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/D3DGroupNodesVersionNotSupported.png)

Right click on the first instruction, select again "_List cross references to..._" and pick the only option available. Right click on the Group Nodes to switch to **text view**, patch the ```js``` instruction by removing it completely and typing ```nop``` instead:

!["JS Instruction to patch"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/JSInstructionToPatch.png)

!["Nop Instruction"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/nopInstruction.png)

Type ```nop``` in the upcoming popups until all the yellow addresses on the left are gone. You should get this result:

!["Nop yellow lines"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/nopYellowLines.png)

We need to repeat the same steps one more time, so go back to **Strings subview** typing the same error message if it is not already being highlighted, right click to list cross references, select the only option available and this time patch the ```jl``` instruction. You should get the same result in the above screen, you should also get 4 different addresses with the following bytes being patched:

!["Patched Bytes second part"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/patchedBytesSecondPart.png)

Click on the IDA View tab and click on **Edit** in the **App Menu** to apply patches to input file:

!["Apply patches"](/images/posts/patchingGodOfWarOnM1WithIdaPro/applyPatches.png)

Use the default settings to generate the output file, in the output window there should be a line saying that the patches have been applied:

```
Applied 14/14 patch(es)
```

You can finally launch the game through crossover and this time, no errors will show up:

## TLDR

Although there was already the video made by **Andrew Tsai** showing how to patch the game, I still wanted to understand how **Nas** found the instructions to patch the game. In this case it wasn't too complicate, just look for the strings in IDA Pro and patch all the instructions leading to Group Nodes responsible to trigger the errors. But it's still nice to practice a bit on these challenges just to see how things are done and if you can also repeat the same steps to get an application running after applying small patches.
