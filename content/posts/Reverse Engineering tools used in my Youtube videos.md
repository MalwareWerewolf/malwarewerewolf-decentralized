Youtube doesn't really like links to reverse engineering resources, especially if you put some downloadable content like an exe file (for obvious reasons). So to avoid pasting in each video description a list with the tools that I used, here's the complete list with all the tools I've used:

- [UPX Packer](https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/tag/v3.96)
- [PEID](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Packers-Crypters-Protectors/PEiD-updated.shtml)
- [Detect-It-Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/DIE-engine/releases)
- [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/#start)
- [Ollydbg](http://www.ollydbg.de/)
- [OllyDumpEx plugin](https://low-priority.appspot.com/ollydumpex/)
- [Scylla](https://github.com/NtQuery/Scylla/releases)
- [CFF Explorer](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388)
- [VMPDump](https://github.com/0xnobody/vmpdump)
- [VMProtect Demo](http://vmpsoft.com/support/download/)
- [Process Hacker](https://github.com/winsiderss/systeminformer)

And here's the list of samples along the corresponding video:
