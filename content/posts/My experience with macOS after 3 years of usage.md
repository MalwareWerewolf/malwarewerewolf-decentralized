I've never been a **macOS** user before, but after so many years working with Windows, I felt that it was the perfect time to try something different, especially considering the birth of the new **Apple Silicon** chips and the death of Intel on mac devices which brought new things to the operating system. Some things I really love about **macOS** but some others I can't really tolerate.

## Coding

Starting off with Coding, macbooks are just one of the best if not the best laptops out there. You will never hear the fan spinning not even a single time unless for some super heavy tasks like rendering, the battery will last forever (expect if you start using it as a workstation), good build quality and speakers, customizable terminal that make you feel like you are on a Linux OS (expect you are not and we will talk about the other aspects later).

And it doesn't stop there, you can type in terminal `xcode-select --install` and it will install Clang, GCC and Git and you can also have package managers like **Homebrew** or **Macports** which work like a package manager on Linux and let you install every tool you need without opening the browser `brew install --cask firefox`

So for stuff like Web Development, you are in good hands, but the problems start to rise when you are coding desktop applications. I recently started my journey to learn 3D Programming and I was utterly shocked when I found out that not only OpenGL has been terribly deprecated, but the support for 3D graphics on mac has been shifted to a new API called Metal, which wouldn't be too bad, if only for the fact that there is almost no documentation available (at least not comparable to OpenGL) and you are basically forced to use **Swift** which again wouldn't be too bad if only you didn't have to use **XCode**.

**XCode** has a notorious fame for being a terrible IDE: buggy, no extensions, no good auto completion, awful UI, weird shortcuts. About the UI, it's probably because I am used to an IDE like Visual Studio or Jetbrains Rider, but working on something so different in every aspect just doesn't make coding a nice and good experience. An IDE is supposed to give you all the tools to code fast and efficiently, not wasting time understanding how a UI it's working without providing support for extensions.

For C++ luckily you are not forced to use XCode, in fact you can either opt for **CLion** or **Qt Creator** or you can be like me and hurt yourself and configure the debugger and a bunch of other stuff in **VSCode** which will help you at the same time to learn other stuff like **make**, **GCC**, **CLang** which you would never learn if you press a button to Run or Debug your code.

## macOS is missing some parts

I will never understand why in macOS you have to install so many tools to be able to even use correctly an operating system. Some of the tools I have installed:

- [AltTab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/) the `CMD + Tab` of macOS is garbage, if you have more windows opened for the same process, you can't switch between them. This tool fixes these problems and add couple of other features.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) another thing that macOS is really bad at is the window management, I guess this was designed to be used with a trackpad and the gestures but it feels so incovenient and not very productive. This tool again fixes these problems and allows you to have resizable windows like on another operating system.
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) it seems that there is a pattern where most of the things on macOS are absolute garbage. macOS is using something called **Spotlight** which works by pressing `CMD + Spacebar` and you can do bunch of stuff like using the calculator, open programs, files which wouldn't be bad if only it wasn't limited in what it does and slow indexing the queries you enter to search for files or folders. This tool not only improves this aspect, but it also adds plugins and it is highly customizable.
- [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) but wait why did I praise before the macOS terminal and now I am suggesting a third party terminal ? It's because the default version is missing lot of features like clickable links, a better search, autocomplete and many [other features](https://iterm2.com/features.html).
- Any other web browser that is not Safari, which is terrible for web development and it manages tabs in a weird way compared to Chrome or Firefox, and it doesn't have the same amount of extensions.

I have installed other tools but they are not essentially required but some worth to mention are:

- [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/)
- [Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats)
- [Hidden Bar](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden)

I think that if an OS force you to install too many tools to be productive or improve its functionality, it's not a good thing since the OS should be designed to offer you only the essentional tools to do your job and then install only the stuff you really need. At least macOS does not have the same amount of bloatware compared to Windows but it still has its own crap as mentioned on the [GNU page](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.html#content) so if you think is better in terms of privacy and telemetry, reconsider that.

## Gaming

This is kinda of a mix, macs are not designed to be gaming machines, but with the recent models, there is been some huge improvements on this side. We got many games ported to macOS like Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4, Death Stranding, No Man's Sky and yet it is still not much in terms of options you can get but luckily [Crossover](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover) is rocking hard providing more support for triple A games and for more legacy stuff there is [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/). So unless you want to play the most recent triple A titles, you are very well covered and as long as you buy a macbook with a fan.

Which bring us to another debate that Apple created, which is the 8GB of RAM being more than enough for most people. This is simply BS because unless you send emails or watch videos on Netflix, you can't simply use a laptop or any device with just 8GB of RAM in 2024. You will run out of RAM very fast considering that nowadays many applications are RAM eaters, like Chrome which is not even a game.

## Emulation is just perfect

I've never had a better experience with emulation in my life before, in terms of gaming you have plenty of emulators which can easily run demanding titles without even overeating the hardware and Parallels just works easily out of the box with the least amount of effort to get stuff working.

## Linux is there but not completely

The **Asahi** team did a pretty good job in collaboration with the **Fedora Project** to improve the OS and deliver US a better experience on Linux ARM as [mentioned here](https://asahilinux.org/2024/01/fedora-asahi-new/), but unfortunately, there are drivers that are still not fully working and it is true that it is already usable but it still has some problems related to speakers, battery draining fast, external monitor not working with macbooks that don't have an HDMI port which don't really make me switch from macOS at the moment.

## Get at least a pro model

I got a macbook pro 13 before Apple stopped shipping them and I gotta say it is a great laptop, but you don't have the necessary ports like HDMI, so you guessed it, spend other bucks buying adapters! So I am saying get at least a pro so you don't have to become mad with this, but one adapter I can recommend is Anker which turned out to be really good.

In Europe the situation is not great, since to get a macbook pro you have to spend now at least 2k euros with no warranty included and with just 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage which is ridiculous.

## Will I ever own a macbook in my own life again ?

Probably not, the reason I bought it was because in 2021 the prices were still ok and I managed to get mine at a good price with warranty included, but now the situation is different and Apple is charging a stupid amount of money for a small upgrade. I know for sure that I will never go back to Windows after experiencing macOS and if I have to choose another laptop, it will probably be a Thinkpad with Linux installed on it.
