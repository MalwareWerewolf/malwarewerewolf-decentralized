Hi there, I'm a **software engineer** who has been working in the **IT** mostly with the **Microsoft stack** since 2019. To be more specific, I have experience with the following technologies:

- **Microsoft Stack**: C#, Visual Studio, .NET Framework/Core, ASP.NET Framework/Core, Entity Framework Core, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Windows Forms, WPF
- **Cloud**: Microsoft Azure and AWS
- **Frontend**: Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Vue.js, Bootstrap, jQuery, Hugo (which I used to develop this website)
- **Operative Systems**: Windows, GNU/Linux, macOS
- **Backend**: C/C++, Java
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Agile Frameworks**: Scrum

In my spare time, I constantly study topics related to computer science also by doing some challenges. Some of these challenges consisted in creating two simple two videogames, they are based on the fighting game style, [Supreme Word Of Fighters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldaEnFMK7nY) and [Warriors of the Astral Plane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_oFZxTJLio) have reached thousands of downloads. 

I also like to contribute to the open source by creating new projects on my GitHub profile. My biggest project is a Discord bot called [RaptorSA](https://github.com/MalwareWerewolf/RaptorSA) which reached more than 50 stars and more than 60 forks on Github. I also got the [Artic Code Vault Contributor](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/) badge on my Github profile, a program made by Github to store code for future generations.

Besides contributing to open source and creating other projects, I make some Youtube videos on my channel to share my knowledge with the community.
